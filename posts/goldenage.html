                            <p>Golden Age can be played <a href="https://decoppelelias.itch.io/golden-age">Here</a>. <br />

                            <h3>The development</h3>
                            <p>I developed this game entirely using the Unity Engine, coding in C#, and creating the graphics myself. 
                                The game architecture revolves around multiple manager scripts, each responsible for a specific aspect of the game. 
                                For instance, one manager handles scene loading, another generates levels, and others track player progress, 
                                manage upgrades, control camera positioning, and adjust lighting. 
                                This modular approach ensures the code is clear and easily expandable. 
                                Each manager interacts only with the managers necessary for its function, 
                                maintaining a streamlined and efficient system.</p>
                            
                            <h3>What I learned</h3>  
                            <p>Creating this game taught me a lot about game development best practices, 
                                especially the importance of modular design. By segmenting responsibilities into different managers, 
                                I learned how to keep code organized and maintainable, which will be invaluable for future projects.</p>
